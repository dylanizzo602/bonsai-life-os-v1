# Start app locally and open in Cursor browser

Run the app locally and open it in Cursor’s browser.

## Steps

1. **Start the dev server**  
   In the project root, run `npm run dev` in the background (so the terminal stays usable).  
   If a dev server is already running in another terminal, skip this step.

2. **Wait for the server**  
   Give the server a few seconds to start (Vite usually listens on http://localhost:5173).

3. **Open in Cursor’s browser**  
   Open http://localhost:5173 in Cursor’s Simple Browser (Command Palette → “Simple Browser: Show”, then enter the URL) or use the in-editor browser so the app is visible inside Cursor.

Complete all steps: start the server if needed, then open http://localhost:5173 in Cursor’s browser.
